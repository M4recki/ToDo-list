## Usage

The ToDo app is a simple web application that allows users to create, edit and delete to-do tasks. Here's how you can use it:

- Registration: To register a new account, go to Sign up in the navigation bar and complete the registration form. Once registration is complete, you will be automatically logged in.

- Logging in: If you already have an account, you can log in by going to Login in the navigation bar and entering your login details.

- Creating tasks: Once you have logged in, you can create new tasks by going to Create ToDo in the navigation bar and filling in the task creation form. Each task must have a specific priority, title and content.

- Editing tasks: You can edit your tasks by going to Your ToDos in the navigation bar and then Edit under each ToDo. You will be redirected to the edit form where you can change the priority, title and content of the task.

- Deleting tasks: To delete a task, go to Your ToDos and then Edit under each ToDo.

- Viewing all tasks: You can see all your tasks by going Your ToDos in the navigation bar. The tasks are displayed in order from newest to oldest.

- Logout: To log out of the system, go to Logout in the navigation bar.

- Please note that all functionality that requires authorisation (creating, editing and deleting tasks) is only available if you are logged in.
